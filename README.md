## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 42 Warsaw student passionate about building innovative projects that solve real-world problems. I thrive on challenges, enjoy collaborating with others, and always look for ways to improve my skills in both systems programming and web development.

## ðŸš€ What I Do

I specialize in creating both low-level system applications and modern web solutions. Whether it's a lightweight HTTP server in C++ or a dynamic website built with Django, I bring dedication, creativity, and technical expertise to every project.
